        <h3>What Does Practical Product Lifespan Mean?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
            Practical Product Lifespan means the usual and customary wearable life of the product. The Practical Product
            Lifespan does not mean for your lifetime or mean a time period that is indefinite. The manner in which the
            product is used directly impacts the usual and customary wearable life of the product, as materials will
            deteriorate and fade over time and moving parts will also wear. Arc’teryx products are designed for long
            life and durability, if care instructions are followed carefully. If your product appears worn out, then it
            may be time to replace your product and we hope that Arc’teryx will be a part of your next buying decision.
            Practical product Lifespan will be determined in the reasonable discretion of an authorized Arc’teryx
            Customer Service representative who shall take into account at least the following factors: the type and
            nature of the product, the nature of the use of the product, nature of the product issue involved, and age
            of the product. The Arc’teryx Customer Service representative may require consumer information in order to
            make the foregoing determination and may not be able to make a determination without such accurate
            information from the consumer.
